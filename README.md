# GraphSearchAlgorithm

A node searching algorithm between undirected relationships. 

Matrix of adjecency list

Un-weigted realtioon, so no extra data
undirected graph
No cycles


Theory
1. DFS (Depth-first search)
Search one root until the end and then go to the nearest unsearched path and continue from there
2. BFS (Breath first search)
start from the top and work your way down, first children and then grandchildren, etc.
